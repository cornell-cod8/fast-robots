## About me

![Me](/headshot.jpg)

My name is Clarence Dagins. I'm a senior engineering student studying computer science. I'm passionate about robotics, especially in its intersections with formal verification methods and CS theory, and I look forward to pursuing these interests in graduate school. Outside of academics, I enjoy personal electronics projects, automotive work, outdoor activities, old-school arcade fighting games, and cats. I'm also a big fan of Star Wars if that wasn't already obvious.

It's been a long time since I've done any web design... this will hopefully look nicer as the year progresses.
