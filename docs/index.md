## About me

![Me](/docs/headshot.jpg)

My name is Clarence Dagins. I'm a senior engineering student studying computer science. I'm passionate about robotics, especially in its intersections with formal verification methods and CS theory. Outside of academics, I enjoy personal electronics projects, automotive work, outdoor activities, old-school arcade fighting games, and cats. 

It's been a long time since I've done any web design, so I'm not too proud of this technological terror I've constructed... this will hopefully look nicer as the year progresses.
