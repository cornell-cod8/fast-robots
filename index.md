## About me

My name is Clarence Dagins. I'm a senior engineering student studying computer science. I'm passionate about robotics, especially in its intersections with formal verification methods and theory, and I'd like to pursue these research interests in graduate school. Outside of academics, I enjoy personal electronics projects, automotive work, outdoor activities, old-school arcade fighting games, and cats. 

It's been a long time since I've done any web design... this will hopefully look nicer as the year progresses.
